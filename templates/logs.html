  <h1>Avianca MyCrew Login Simulation</h1>
  <p>This is a simulation and will not actually log you into the Avianca MyCrew website.</p>

  <script>
    function simulateLogin() {
      const email = "sergio.jimenez@avianca.com";
      const password = "aLogout.87878787";
      const crewAppToken = "your_simulated_jwt_token"; // Replace with a dummy token

      // Simulate setting the crewapptoken in localStorage
      localStorage.setItem('crewapptoken', crewAppToken);
      console.log('Simulated crewapptoken set in localStorage:', localStorage.getItem('crewapptoken'));

      // You cannot directly interact with or submit cross-origin forms using client-side JavaScript due to security restrictions (CORS).
      // This simulation will only demonstrate setting the localStorage item.

      // In a real scenario, the login would involve:
      // 1. User entering credentials.
      // 2. JavaScript sending these credentials to the Avianca server via an API request (likely a POST request).
      // 3. The server authenticating the user.
      // 4. Upon successful authentication, the server would return a JWT (crewapptoken).
      // 5. JavaScript would then store this JWT in localStorage.
      // 6. Subsequent requests to fetch schedule data would include this JWT in the Authorization header.
      // 7. The page would then use JavaScript to fetch and display the schedule data, likely from another API endpoint.

      // This simulation stops at setting the token in localStorage.
      console.log('Login simulation complete. Check your browser\'s Local Storage (Application tab in DevTools).');
      console.log('A real login would involve a server-side process to authenticate and issue a token.');

      // To simulate the schedule content printing, we'll just create a dummy JSON object:
      const dummySchedule = {
        "schedule": [
          {"date": "2025-05-22", "flight": "AV123", "origin": "BOG", "destination": "MDE"},
          {"date": "2025-05-23", "flight": "AV456", "origin": "CLO", "destination": "ADZ"}
          // ... more schedule entries
        ]
      };

      console.log('Simulated Schedule Content:', JSON.stringify(dummySchedule, null, 2));
    }

    // Since we cannot directly interact with the Avianca login page,
    // we will simulate the login process when this page (the simulation) loads.
    simulateLogin();
